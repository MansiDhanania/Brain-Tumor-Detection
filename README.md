# Brain-Tumor-Detection
Detection of Brain Tumors from MRI Scans Using MATLAB


This project aims to detect brain tumors from MRI Scans using MATLAB.
Image Processing techniques have been applied to detect the tumor formation.
There are four different parts/methods implemented, thus 4 MATLAB code files.
